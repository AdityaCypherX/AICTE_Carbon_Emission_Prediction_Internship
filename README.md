# AICTE_Carbon_Emission_Prediction_Internship

🌍 Carbon Emission Prediction:
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing country-specific climate, demographic, economic, and energy usage data to predict CO₂ emissions using machine learning techniques. The data is sourced from the Climate Change Data provided by the World Bank Group, covering a wide range of countries from 1990 to 2011.

By building predictive models, the goal is to understand which features most influence CO₂ emissions and to provide insight into emission patterns across different countries.

🧠 Problem Statement:
"Analysis of country-specific data and development of machine learning models in order to predict CO₂ emissions from country parameters."

The motivation behind this project is to assist policymakers, researchers, and environmental scientists in better understanding the key factors that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, and potentially use these insights for informed decision-making and sustainable development planning.



🔍 Dataset Description
The dataset includes yearly data for most countries between 1990 and 2011, with features across several domains:

Greenhouse Gas Emissions: CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, etc.
Demographics: Population, urban population, growth rate
Economic Indicators: GDP, GNI, Foreign Direct Investment
Land Use: Agricultural land, cereal yield, protected areas
Climate Data: Precipitation, natural disasters
Energy Consumption: Total energy use
Health Infrastructure: Medical personnel counts
Others: Additional socioeconomic indicators



🔧 Project Structure
The project is divided into two major stages:

1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
